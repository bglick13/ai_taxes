    "\n",
    "Foundation is the name of the economic simulator built for the AI Economist ([paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13332)). This is the first of several tutorials designed to explain how Foundation works and how it can be used to build simulation environments for studying economic problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to orient you a bit, Foundation is specially designed for modeling economies in spatial, 2D grid worlds. The AI Economist paper uses a scenario with 4 agents in a world with *Stone* and *Wood*, which can be *collected*, *traded*, and used to build *Houses*. Here's a (nicely rendered) example of what such an environment looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Foundation snapshot](assets/foundation_snapshot_rendered.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "This image just shows what you might see spatially. Behind the scenes, agents have inventories of Stone, Wood, and *Coin*, which they can exchange through a commodities marketplace. In addition, they periodically pay taxes on income earned through trading and building.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We've open-sourced Foundation to foster transparency and to enable others to build on it!** With that goal in mind, this first tutorial should give you enough to see how to create the type of simulation environment described above and how to interact with it. If you're interested to learn how it all works and how to build on it, make sure to check out the advanced tutorial as well! If, after that, you want to understand more about designing the simulation around economic problems, check out our tutorial explaining how the AI Economist uses Foundation to study the optimal taxation problem!"

    "MDPs describe episodes in which agents interact with a stateful environment in a continuous feedback loop. At each timestep, agents receive an observation and use a policy to choose actions. The environment then advances to a new state, using the old state and the chosen actions. The agents then receive new observations and rewards. This process repeats over $T$ timesteps (possibly infinite).\n",
